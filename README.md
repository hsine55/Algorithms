# Algorithms

In this repo I am trying to implement some of the known algorithms. Currently, the following algorithms are implemented :

  - Karger's min Cut algorithm
  - Quick Sort
  - Algorithm to Count the inversions in an array
  - Korasaju's Algorithm for calculating the strongly connected components in a directed graph
